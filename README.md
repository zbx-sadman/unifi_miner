Fastest client-server version of UniFi Miner is [UniFi Proxy](https://github.com/zbx-sadman/unifi_proxy). 

It is a small tool written in Perl, which helps deliver to the monitoring system (Zabbix) operational data - metrics and settings obtained from the UniFi controller via API, provided by Ubiquiti. Zabbix's Low-level Discovery (LLD) protocol are supported.
